			<p>I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</p>
			<p>Red Five standing by. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. <strong> I want to come with you to Alderaan.</strong> <em> There's nothing for me here now.</em> I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
			<p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>
			<p>I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! What!? Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. I'm trying not to, kid. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.</p>
